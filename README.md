# ScreenSnap

Pressing the PrintScreen button will only copy one image to the clipboard, at which point it must be pasted somewhere. This presents a problem when one wants to take many screenshots at once.

Enter ScreenSnap.

## Features

* Screenshots are automatically saved to a folder of your choosing.
* The background program that saves the images can be enabled and disabled using the UI program.
* The save folder can be opened, modified, and emptied in the UI program.
* The background program launches immediately upon install.
* The background program launches upon Windows startup.

## Installation

The application can be installed using the latest MSI on [the releases page](https://github.com/WKHAllen/ScreenSnap/releases).
